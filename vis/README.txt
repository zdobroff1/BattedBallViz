The attached file "bbvis.html" was tested in Firefox and should run when opened in browser. Additionally, there is a folder named "BattedBallData" that contains the file "ALWestBattedBalls2017".csv which contains the data required to run the program, a file "14.svg" (from https://prod-gameday.mlbstatic.com/responsive-gameday-assets/1.2.0/images/fields/14.svg) that contains an image of Rogers Centre and a file "Polar-graph.png" (from https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/polar-graph) that contains a simple polar coordinate graph. Also included are "BattedBallDefinitions.csv" and "coordinates.png", neither are necessary to run the program. Note that it may be necessary to disable CORS in your browser.  

When opened, you should see a series of dropdowns used for filters, changing any of them and pressing the submit button will update the visualization with the chosen data and color scheme. The main visualization is a graphic of Rogers Centre with a scatter plot representing balls in play. Hovering over any point will bring up more info about that batted ball. Off to the side there are two more visualizations, the left is a polar chart showing launch angle vs exit velocity, the right is a strike zone approximation. Again, hovering over any point will bring up more info about that batted ball. At the bottom are two sliders used to further filter the data by launch angle and exit velocity. Note that the sliders are based on the work found here: https://bl.ocks.org/johnwalley/e1d256b81e51da68f7feb632a53c3518
